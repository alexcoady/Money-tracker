#Money tracker
A simple backbone money tracker for personal use

Will use RequireJS, Backbone localStorage, d3 for data visualisation and potentially a RESTful API with a PHP or Node backend at a later date. Also using twitter bootstrap for the UI.

Feel free to contribute, but no additional 3rd party plugins are welcome at this stage.

To install, clone the repo and `cd/to/directory` in Terminal

Run `npm install` and `bower install` to install local environment files and bower components (jQuery, Backbone etc).

Run `grunt server` or `grunt build` and explore the `dist` directory.
